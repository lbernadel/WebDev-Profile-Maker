# WebDev-Profile-Maker

## Description
The purpose of this assignment is to use the ES6 version of JavaScript language and Node.js in unison with the Axios & Inquirer NPMs to create a command-line application that brings up developer information on GitHub when a valid username is entered. Using this, it creates a Markdown file about the user with the following profile information:
- Display Name
- Profile Picture/Avatar
- Location
- Bio
- Link to User's Repo
- Number of Public Repos
- Number of Followers
- Number of People the User Follows
  
The user's display name is displayed in one of the following colors: red, blue, pink, green, purple, and orange. This is chosen after the user enters their username.

Relevant class topics: Node.js, Node Package Manager(NPM), JavaScript ES6

## Challenges
It took me a while to understand how to use Axios and Inquirer together in order to write a Markdown file, since I missed the relevant activity in class due to a personal emergency. But once I understood it, it wasn't too difficult after all. I also had an issue with the styling of of the Markdown. It took a while to find out how to change the font color and size.
